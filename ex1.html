For example, you are going to meet the <em> element </em> that allows <q>you to indicate where emphasis should be placed on selected words and <dfn>the element</dfn> which indicates that a block of text is a quotation.</q> Both elements may use the cite attribute to indicate where the quote is from. Its value should be a URL that will have more information about the source of the <cite>quotation.</cite> </p></blockquote>

you might want to add a list
of contents that links to the
corresponding sections lower
down. Or you might want to add
a link from part way down the
page back to the top of it to save
users from having to scroll back
to the top Therefore, the href attribute

reasons a web page author
might want a link to be opened
in a new window is if it points to
another website. In such cases,
they hope the user will return
to the window containing their
site after finishing looking at the
other one.
Generally you should avoid
opening links in a new window,
but if you do, it is considered
good practice to inform users
that the link will open a new
window before they click on it If you want to link to a specific
part of a different page (whether
on your own site or a different
website) you can use a similar
technique.
As long as the page you are
linking to has id attributes that
identify specific parts of the
page, you can simply add the
same syntax to the end of the
link for that page.</p></dd>
